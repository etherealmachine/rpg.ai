Describe the current location and the character's place in the scene, from the
character's perspective (second person). Use the previous scenes, object, and
NPCs if possible. Don't mention any secrets unless they've been revealed in a
previous scene. If any NPCs would logically approach the players, do so, and
speak to the characters with the NPC's voice (first person).
