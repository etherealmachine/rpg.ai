Call the `describe_scene` function to describe the location and their place in
the scene, from the character's perspective (second person). Use the previous
interactions and demeanor if possible. Don't mention secrets unless they've been
revealed in a previous interaction. Do try to incorporate hooks into the
description if possible, or have an NPC mention the hook. If any NPCs would
logically approach the players, do so, and speak to the characters with the
NPC's voice (first person).
