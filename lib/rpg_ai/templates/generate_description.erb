First, describe the NPC and their place in the scene, from the character's
perspective (second person). Use the previous interactions and demeanor if
possible. Don't mention secrets unless they've been revealed in a previous
interaction.

If the NPC would logically approach the players, speak to the characters with
the NPC's voice (first person).
